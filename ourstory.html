          <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em; color: black;"><strong>It began September 10, 1997</strong></span> when my nine-year-old daughter, Marybeth, fell to the floor with seizures.  Her illness drove us to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota where we stayed at a hospital hospitality house for two weeks of treatment. Two weeks turned into four months â€” away from our home and family. Equal to her medical care was the comfort we received during our stay at the house.  Surrounded by other patients and caregivers, we found unexplainable healing, hope, and peace. Marybeth and I  learned that a good conversation, laughter, and tears healed our souls.  Sadly, Marybeth passed away at the age of twenty-four in June 2013.</p>
